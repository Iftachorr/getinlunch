<p>It's a super light project for conducting random lunches in your organization.
Simply create a JSON file with all people that participate and run the script 
on the morning of the intended date for the lunch and everyone will get an email
with the groups they are on.</p>

<p>It's a way for a medium and big organization to get people to socialize with 
one another more by assigning them in random groups for lunch time.
Simply tell everyone about it and schedule the script to run once a weeks.</p>
