### What's Get in Lunch?
It's a super light project for conducting random lunches in your organization.
Simply create a JSON file with all people that participate and run the script
on the morning of the intended date for the lunch and everyone will get an email
with the groups they are on.

### What's a 'Random Lunch'?
It's a way for a medium and big organization to get people to socialize with
one another more by assigning them in random groups for lunch time.
Simply tell everyone about it and schedule the script to run once a weeks.

### Who made this?
Me, Iftach, when I was given the challenge to merge between two departments
in SimilarWeb, and I had to get everyone to get to know one another.
